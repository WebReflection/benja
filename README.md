Bootable Electron Node JS Application

## Abandoned

Due lack of support, this project is currently unsustainable, but its installer has been improved and **moved** over **[archibold.io/benja](https://archibold.io/benja/)**.

Alternatively, I have suggested a [DIY alternative](https://medium.com/@WebReflection/a-minimalistic-64-bit-web-kiosk-for-rpi-3-98e460419b47) that doesn't boot into Electron.
